# Plantly-Android
Kotlin based android app that utilises the Trefle.io API.
This app is intended as a catalogue system for botanists.

UPDATE:
The Trefle API is no longer live and, as a result, this application will no longer behave as intended.
Nevertheless, all code will remain available as example code for future works.
All code will still run, with developer integrated fallbacks working in place of the API.
